## A database of thermodynamic and transport properties of gaseous species

This repository contains a collection of NASA polynomials for thermodynamic properties and Lennard-Jones parameters for gaseous species. The data were compiled from public databases between 2007 and 2025—some of which are no longer accessible. The information may be outdated, so use it at your own risk.

I've used these data in various research contexts, and you may find them useful—especially when dealing with unknown species in CFD simulations.

If you've found your way here, I assume you know what you're doing, so I won't go into detailed explanations of the data. The format for most of data is explained [here](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/JANAF-thermochemical-tables-to-NASA-Glenn-coefficients-converter).

This repository will be updated at my own pace (or not). If you recognize any file you authored and would like it removed, please let me know.
