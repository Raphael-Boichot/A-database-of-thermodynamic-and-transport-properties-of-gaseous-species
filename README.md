## A database of thermodynamic and transport properties of gaseous species

A bunch of NASA polynomials for thermodynamic properties and Lennard Jones parameters for gaseous species I've collected. All data were gathered from public database between 2007 and 2025. Some are probably outdated so you may use them at your own risk. I've used these data in various research contexts and you may take inspiration from them in case you have an unknown species to deal with in CFD simulation.

If you land here I guess that you know what you are doing so I won't explain what are all of these.

This repository will be augmented at my own pace (or not)
